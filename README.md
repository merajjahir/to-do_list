on the landing window the user can click the plus sign and create an input 
field and they can enter input info there and afterward's they can  press 
enter that will get the info form the input element to a h2 element.

the user then can be able to see the element of status which will set to 
due by default but the user can toggle it to done by clicking on it .
and the save button will save all the tasks to the databse then the 
task's can be accessable from the typeahead input field which is located in menu

# can be search with title and date

then the user can either update the to-do's or delete them completely from the database

# there is a catch tho , as the plus sign doesn't really save the todo's it only 
# create's a line to write one the cross icon/the delete icon also dosen't delete them 
# it remove's a line from todo . the main insert and delete happne's with the save and  
# delete button
